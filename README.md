# ðŸ“¬ SendGrid Parse Webhook Handler (TypeScript + Supabase)

A lightweight TypeScript-based webhook handler that receives and stores incoming email data from [SendGrid's Inbound Parse Webhook](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook) into **Supabase**.

> ðŸ›  Originally built for [GTAPoliceMods](https://gtapolicemods.com) as a temporary internal solution. Now released for the open-source community following my departure from the team.
